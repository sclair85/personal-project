# Game Website - Sam's Project

With my project I will attempt to make a game website. The games will be just short little time wasters to play on a boring afternoon. For now all of these will me various types of 2D games or puzzle games. Also considering adding a few retro games at some point.


## Short-term goals

I will make the web page look better and work out out and bugs in the current game. I will also add more information to this README file as I progress. 

## Long-term goals

I will add more games, categories and possibly go beyond just games. 

## How I will be challenged

This will challenge me by giving me a chance to work out all my weaknesses with the dom amoung many other things with JavaScript.
